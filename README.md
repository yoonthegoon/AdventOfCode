# AdventOfCode

An Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and
skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## About

I plan on using [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) to build up my
experience in languages I'm less familiar with.
If after a problem becomes too tough, I'll likely default to my native tongue,
[Python 🐍](https://www.python.org/).

The structure is as shows below:

```tree
.
├── 2015
│   ├── day01
│   │   ├── main.pl
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── day02
│   │   ├── main.pl
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
├── 2016
│   ├── day01
│   │   ├── main.pl
│   │   └── README.md
│   ├── day02
│   │   ├── main.pl
│   │   └── README.md
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

Inside each day's folder, there will be a main.pl file with solutions to parts
1 and 2 for that day where pl is the file extension of the programming language
I used.
Details about what the problem is, how I worked through solving it, and even
just how to run my solution will be in each day's README.md.
